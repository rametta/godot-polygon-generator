# 🍄 Godot Polygon Generator

> Disclaimer: Godot provides [TubeTrailMesh](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_tubetrailmesh.html) which is very similar and should probably be used instead of this.

A polygon generator tool for Godot to create simple shapes using **S-Curves**.

Once a shape has been created: save the shape as a `.tres` file to use statically in game.
